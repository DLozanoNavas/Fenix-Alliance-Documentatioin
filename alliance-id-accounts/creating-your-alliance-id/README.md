# Create your Alliance ID

## Creating your Alliance ID through an identity provider: \(e.g. Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google...\)

 If you donâ€™t already have an Alliance ID account, you can get it for free by using those accounts that you already own and use \(like your social media accounts\). For this matter,  you will need to select the identity provider of your choice when you [create your Alliance ID](https://fenixalliance.com.co/Account/SignIn). 

{% hint style="info" %}
 You will need to login in your Alliance ID tenant through that identity provider to get access to your account and resources.
{% endhint %}

## Creating your Alliance ID through a local account.

We want to give you options. If you don't want to use or you don't have any social media account, you can go old style and create your Alliance ID Account through your Email address. This will mean for you that you will need to verify that email address through a code. This will also enable password for your account, so you will need to provide a strong password to continue with your sign up process.
