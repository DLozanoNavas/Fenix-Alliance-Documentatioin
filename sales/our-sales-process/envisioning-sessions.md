# FastTrack Assistance

### Get Invited

If you as a customer are not currently registered on FastTrack portal, we can send you an invitation so that you can connect with us on FastTrack.

#### How do I request FastTrack Assistance to assist on my/my client's Microsoft 365 migration/onboarding?

There are two ways you can request FastTrack assistance. One way is by fully completing a **Success Plan**. Once you have answered all required questions on the Success Plan the green ‘Request FastTrack Assistance’ button will light up on the Success Plan summary page. The benefit of requesting assistance this way is that you can import the information you have added to your Success Plan directly into your request for assistance. The second way you can request assistance is by navigating to the Services tab and clicking ‘Learn More’ next to the Request Assistance with Microsoft 365 card in the Services tab of your company record.

#### What is a success plan?

The success plan captures the intent of the customer's project by prompting the customer to answer a series of questions about the activities and workloads for the project. The success plan further recommends preparation and remediation activities and resources based on the specific details provided in the success plan.

#### How do I request a success plan?

A Success Plan can be requested by navigating to the Success Plans tab of your or your company's Project record and clicking on the ‘Create Success Plan’ button. 

You will provide the name of the plan, a short description, select the plan type, and add your expected start and completion dates.

#### Why is my Success Plan not showing as completed?

The most common reason your success plan is not showing as completed is because there is a field\(s\) within the plan that has not yet been filled out or it's FastTrack twin haven't been provisioned yet. Please ensure that all fields in all three tabs \(Plan Scope, Timelines, Contacts\) of the success plan are filled. The required questions will be indicated by a red asterisk.

#### As a partner, how do we request access to our client’s company record?

We request access to our client’s company record by searching for your client in the FastTrack Dashboard. Once we find our client’s search tile, we Request Access - this will prompt us to input the email alias of our client \(this must be the alias that you used to register with the FastTrack site\). Our client will then receive both an email and a notification within FastTrack to approve this request.

#### I've received an Email is my client’s company displaying a message that reads – ‘Cloud tenant not found’

When you [create a business through our portal](https://fenixalliance.com.co/business/mybusiness/create), we associate this record with what is called a ‘provisional’  FastTrack company record. This is a company record that does not have a customer user associated with it, and therefore a tenant has not been associated yet. To ensure a Business Tenant is associated with your FastTrack company record, you can request an invitation through the [Support Form](https://fenixalliance.com.co/support/contact). Once your client has successfully registered at FastTrack.microsoft.com, the domain that you invite the client with will then be associated with their company record.

#### How do I export a PDF version of my success plan?

You have the option of exporting your Success Plan by selecting the ‘Plan Output’ button within your Success Plan on the summary page. An Email will be sended with your Success Plan PDF File.
