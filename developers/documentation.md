Welcome to Fenix Alliance's REST API reference for the v2.0 endpoint.

API sets on the v2.0 endpoint \(`https://fenixalliance.com.co/api/v2`\) are in general availability \(GA\) status, and have gone through a rigorous review-and-feedback process with customers to meet practical, production needs. Updates to APIs on this endpoint are additive in nature and do not break existing app scenarios.
