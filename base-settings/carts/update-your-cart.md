# Tenant Carts

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.

## Registrations Timespan Policy

When you add a product, a service or a managed cloud resource to your cart, it will create a **Cart Registration**. This registrations will be available for you to customize your order preferences and place orders or provisioning requests in just a click. Cart registrations for your Alliance ID Tenant Cart won't be deleted until the first day of each month.
