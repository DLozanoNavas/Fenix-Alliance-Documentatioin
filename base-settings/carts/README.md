# Carts



{% hint style="info" %}
Carts define the currency and localization for the entire interface. This means that it will control the display currency for things like offers pricing, CRM and accounting suite records, and personalize our offers based on your country.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Keep in mind that currency exchange rates are only for display purposes and you will be able to select the base price for every "**Price Input**". This will allow us to make conversions based on current and historical exchange rates, depending on the record type.
