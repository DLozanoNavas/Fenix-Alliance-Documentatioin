# Guest Carts

## How is different my Guest Cart from my Tenant Cart?

The main difference is that your Tenant Shopping Cart has a slot for your Account ID, while your guest cart contains a slot for your IP address.

Another difference is that guest carts are just for instant navigation for our offerings,but they are actually not suited to place an order through your guest cart.

Also, [Andy](https://fenixalliance.com.co/cognitive/andy), our support bot, is programmed to empty every guest cart on our database ant midnight every two days.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to prevent cart deletion, you can login to your Alliance ID Account to use your Tenant Cart for pre-order adjustments. **Tenant carts have a timespan of 31 days.**  
{% endhint %}

## Guest Cart timespan policy.

**Your guest cart will be deleted every 48 hours**, which means that products on your guest cart might need to be added to your cart again if an old cart has already been deleted.
